# Notes App

Notes App is a simple note taking app built with Kotlin, using Room Database, Jetpack Compose, and MVVM architecture.

## Features

* Create, edit, and delete notes
* Sort notes by creation time, modification time, or title
* Search notes by title or content
* Share notes via email or messaging
* Backup and restore notes to Google Drive

## Architecture

Notes App uses the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture. The Model contains the data and business logic of the app. The View is responsible for displaying the data and interacting with the user. The ViewModel is the bridge between the Model and the View, helping to separate business logic from the UI.

## Technologies

* Kotlin: Android's official programming language
* Room Database: An object-relational mapping database for Android
* Jetpack Compose: Android's new UI framework
* MVVM architecture: A popular app architecture that separates business logic from the UI
